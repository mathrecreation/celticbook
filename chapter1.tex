\chapter{2$\times$2 patterns}

If we omit patterns that are rotations of other patterns in the list, the collection of 81 2$/times$2 patterns reduces to a more manageable set of 24. Within that list there are 3 pairs of patterns that are reflections of other tiles, reducing the list down to 21 distinct patterns.

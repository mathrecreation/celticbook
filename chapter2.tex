\chapter{Some 2$\times$3 patterns}

A 2$\times$3 grid has 7 possible crossing points, each crossing can either be open, or blocked horizontally or vertically, providing 3$^{7}=$2187 possible patterns, with some being rotations or reflections of other patterns in the list. If all spaces are open, a single continuous plait is formed.

With too many figures to list here, we'll present lists of figures that contain larger numbers of crossings.
